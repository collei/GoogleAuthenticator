# Google Authenticator

Ported from http://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/

You can use the Google Authenticator app from here
http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1066447
to generate One Time Passwords/Tokens and check them with this little
PHP app (Of course, you can also create them with this).

## Installation using Composer

```bash
composer require sonata-project/google-authenticator
```

**Only If composer does not find it at Packagist.org**, include the following in your composer.json:

```json
	"repositories": [
		{
			"url": "https://github.com/collei/GoogleAuthenticator.git",
			"type": "git"
		}
	]
```

## Usage

See example.php for how to use it.

There's a little web app showing how it works in web/, please make users.dat
writeable for the webserver, doesn't really work otherwise (it can't save the
secret). Try to login with chregu/foobar.

What's missing in the example:

 * Prevent replay attacks. One token should only be used once
 * Show QR Code only when providing password again (or not at all)
 * Regenerate secret
